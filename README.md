# 8 Puzzle and 15 Puzzle Solver
A simple 8 Puzzle and 15 Puzzle solver app for Android

This uses an A star search algorithm to find a solution. It uses both manhattan and hamming hueristics to determine which move to make next. It can determine if a puzzle is initially solvable. 

I made this app only to supplement and visualize [this programming assignment](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall12/cos226/assignments/8puzzle.html) I decided to complete to improve my computer science skills. 

To further improve this app. It would useful to implement a cache for the hueristic functions to improve speed. To save memory, it would be beneficial to implement the IDA star algorithm instead.
